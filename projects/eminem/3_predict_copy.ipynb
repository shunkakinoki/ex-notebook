       "\" I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts You know, there's a story behind that there saloon Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em, quickest damn gun slinger I've ever seen Got murdered in cold blood, that ol' saloon there was their lil' home Away from home, they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live In that tavern and on a quiet night, you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine  I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said  Who hard? yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the devil, intelligence level is hellier than Treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto  Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist Intercepting missiles wit my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth  'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal Above the law 'cuz I don't agree wit police either We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle  I breathe ether in three amounts When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain He's insane, no I'm not, I just want to shoot up And I'm pissed off 'cuz I can't find a decent vain  The disaster wit dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough To kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 'Cuz I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral  Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows crackin' jaws Wit my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin' to me From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt  Hello? Billy, aiyyo what's up We're comin' to get you Stop, they know it's us  I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? I'm the one who burned your house down Well I'm out now, and this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up And I ain't gone leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe  'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel We'll be waitin', See you in hell Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady See you in hell for the sequel, bye bye Bad meets evil, what? Till next time  {And so that's the story when bad meets evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon But their spirits still live on till this day Wait, did y'all hear that?}</p> ]\""
